Create and activate a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
Install the required libraries (opencv-python, cvzone, mouse, pyautogui, numpy) using pip.
Verify the installation by running a test script.


1. Setting Up a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment helps isolate your project and manage dependencies. Here's how to create and activate a virtual environment:

2.Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

3.Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

4. Installing Libraries
Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required libraries using pip.

Install OpenCV:
pip install opencv-python

Install CVZone:
pip install cvzone

Install Mouse:
pip install mouse

Install PyAutoGUI:
pip install pyautogui

Install NumPy (if not already installed):
pip install numpy
