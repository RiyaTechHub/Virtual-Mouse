# Virtual-Mouse
This project utilizes computer vision and hand tracking to control mouse using hand gestures. The implementation uses OpenCV for video capture, CVZone for hand detection, and PyAutoGUI for controlling the screen.

Features:
- **Mouse Control**: Move the mouse cursor with the index finger.
- **Mouse Clicks**: 
  - Left-click using index and middle fingers close together.
  - Right-click using index, middle, and ring fingers close together.
- **Double Click**: Double-click using only the index finger.
- **Mouse Scroll**: 
  - Scroll up using index, middle, and thumb fingers.
  - Scroll down using index, middle, thumb, and ring fingers.

The Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures project has several practical applications in the current scenario, especially given the increasing demand for touchless interfaces and innovative ways to interact with technology.
